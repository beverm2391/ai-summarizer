The core mechanisms of CBT that are discussed in Powers' study (2017) include fear extinction, cognitive change through cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation, and identifying treatment mediators to improve interventions (p.620-621). In particular, research suggests that threat reappraisal is proposed as a mediator for the efficacy of CBT in anxiety disorders and is associated with symptom reduction (Powers, 2017, p. 623).
