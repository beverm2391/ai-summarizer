Cognitive change is observed in both antidepressant and CBT interventions. It is also observed in both cognitive cognitive restructuring and behavioral behavioral activation therapies. Overall cognitive change is important in CBT for both anxiety and depression in whatever manner it is achieved. It may be that cognitive change is important and one of the best ways to convince someone to change their mind is through giving them experience exposure behavioral experiments.
