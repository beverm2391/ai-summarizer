# Structural Racism and Maternal Health Among Black Women

In her article, "Structural Racism and Maternal Health Among Black Women" (Taylor, 2020), Taylor argues that bias, discrimination, and racism in the healthcare system contribute to maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women. The article provides a thorough examination of the historical and systemic factors that contribute to racial disparities in maternal health outcomes among Black women. Taylor notes that social determinants such as education, income, and access to care do not protect Black women when they are invisible to the healthcare system, and their cries for help are ignored. 

The invisibility of Black women that occurs at the hands of healthcare providers and the healthcare system is rooted in bias, discrimination, and racism. It is a driver of maternal mortality and morbidity (Taylor, 2020, p. 508). Structural racism and reproductive oppression have led to vast racial disparities in maternal health outcomes among Black women. Provider bias and racism within the healthcare system are important contributors to these disparities. 

## Historical Context of Reproductive Oppression

The article provides historical context and examples of how structural racism has impacted Black women's maternal health outcomes. Taylor discusses the history of reproductive oppression and sterilization abuse among Black women in the United States. The South was the first region to perform forced sterilizations, but sterilization abuse was not confined to the southern region. Physicians, social workers, and members of state eugenics boards worked together to sterilize low-income Black women with the intention of reducing the number of Black women eligible for public assistance. Black women continued to organize around reproductive justice, taking into account the economic disadvantage and sexual discrimination that many of them experienced in their daily lives (Taylor, 2020).

For Black women, the historical context of reproductive oppression and mistreatment they have endured at the hands of the medical establishment is understandable (Taylor, 2020, p. 509). Over 10% of Black mothers reported experiencing discrimination due to race or ethnicity during their hospital stay for childbirth, which was significantly higher than any other racial or ethnic group (Taylor, 2020). This is one example of how structural racism manifests in the healthcare system and impacts Black women's maternal health outcomes.

## Solutions for Improving Public Policies and Health Practices

The article offers solutions for improving public policies and health practices to ensure equitable and respectful healthcare for Black women. All states must fully expand Medicaid, which has been proven to help drive down maternal and infant mortality rates (Taylor, 2020, p. 515). Activism and policy change are necessary to hold systems and institutions accountable and center the health and social concerns of women of color in social justice movements. Health equity is essential to combating the maternal mortality crisis and requires commitment and concerted effort from policymakers, healthcare systems, and providers.

## Implications for Social Work Practice

As a social worker, one can incorporate the points of this article into their practice by advocating for policy changes that promote reproductive justice and address the intersecting oppressions of race, class, and gender. Social workers can work with clients to address issues related to reproductive health and access to healthcare, particularly for marginalized populations. Social workers can also prioritize cultural humility and sensitivity in their interactions with clients and work to identify and address the impact of structural racism and discrimination on their health outcomes.
