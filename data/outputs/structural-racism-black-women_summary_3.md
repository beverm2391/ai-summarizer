# Structural Racism and Maternal Health Among Black Women: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

The article by Taylor (2020) brings to light a significant and pressing issue in the United States â€“ the impact of structural racism on maternal health outcomes among Black women. This essay aims to provide a detailed analysis of the subject, exploring the historical context of reproductive oppression, institutional practices rooted in racism, and the role of social determinants of health in shaping these outcomes. Furthermore, the essay will discuss the potential role of social workers in addressing these issues and advocating for change.

## Historical Context of Reproductive Oppression

Taylor (2020) emphasizes the importance of understanding the historical context of reproductive oppression among Black women in the United States to comprehend the current maternal health disparities. During the antebellum period, enslaved women were subjected to various forms of reproductive control and exploitation, including forced mating, experimental surgeries, and denial of reproductive autonomy (Taylor, 2020). As a result, Black women have historically been devalued and commodified, contributing to present-day disparities in maternal health outcomes.

## Institutional Practices and Racism in Healthcare

The article by Taylor (2020) highlights the role of institutional practices and racism within the healthcare system in perpetuating maternal health disparities among Black women. The author argues that "poor maternal health outcomes among Black women cannot solely be attributed to social determinants like poverty and educational attainment or access to healthcare" (Taylor, 2020, p. 506) but must also consider the harmful institutional practices by healthcare providers.

These practices, rooted in negative cultural representations of Black women, include racial bias in diagnosis and treatment, inadequate pain management, and disregard for Black women's complaints and concerns (Taylor, 2020). The author emphasizes the need for healthcare providers to address their biases and engage in culturally sensitive care to improve health outcomes for Black women.

## Social Determinants of Health and Structural Racism

Taylor (2020) contends that structural racism is a powerful social determinant of maternal health that has roots in historical systems of oppression and devaluation of women of color. The author explains that addressing individual-level factors such as socioeconomic status and access to healthcare is not sufficient in addressing maternal health disparities among Black women. Instead, it is crucial to examine the broader social context and the role of structural racism in shaping these outcomes (Taylor, 2020).

## Role of Social Workers in Addressing Maternal Health Disparities

While the article by Taylor (2020) focuses primarily on healthcare providers in addressing the issue of maternal health disparities among Black women, it is essential to recognize the potential role of social workers in this context. Social workers can incorporate the points raised in the article into their practice by advocating for policy changes and reforms that address bias and racism within the healthcare system, providing culturally sensitive and responsive care to Black women and other vulnerable populations, and addressing power imbalances in the healthcare system.

Furthermore, social workers can empower clients to be advocates for their own healthcare needs and to navigate the healthcare system effectively while providing emotional support and addressing any trauma-related concerns that may be impacting their health outcomes (Taylor, 2020).

## Conclusion

The article by Taylor (2020) provides a comprehensive analysis of the historical context, institutional practices, and social determinants of health that contribute to maternal health disparities among Black women in the United States. As social workers, it is crucial to be aware of these factors and actively work to address them within the healthcare system and beyond. By advocating for policy changes, providing culturally competent care, and addressing systemic issues of racism and oppression, social workers can play a vital role in improving maternal health outcomes for Black women and promoting health equity.
