# Structural Racism and Maternal Health Among Black Women

The power dynamic between Black enslaved women and white slaveholders created a foundation for the reproductive oppression of Black women which still exists today (Taylor, 2020). Forced sterilization and the eugenics movement were tools of racial control, perpetuating a system of racial control and suppression of reproductive freedom that continues to impact Black women today (Taylor, 2020). 

The promotion of birth control as a tool of racial control in the 1960s targeted Black women, framing birth control as a racial issue rather than an issue of reproductive freedom (Taylor, 2020). Racism and reproductive oppression have also shaped Black women's experiences with health care providers during childbirth and the postpartum period, leading to disparities in maternal health outcomes (Taylor, 2020).

## Addressing Structural Racism and Maternal Health

Improving public policies and health practices to ensure quality health care that is equitable and respectful of Black women is essential for improving maternal health outcomes. This includes training health care providers to recognize and address bias and racism in health care settings and developing policies to ensure access to comprehensive postpartum care (Taylor, 2020).

In order to address the issue of structural racism and maternal health among Black women, it is crucial to develop strategies that target racism and bias within the healthcare system (Taylor, 2020, p. 512-513). These strategies must include removing barriers to healthcare access, providing antiracism and bias trainings to healthcare providers, and ensuring a more diverse and culturally competent healthcare workforce (Taylor, 2020, p. 512-513). Research has shown that Medicaid expansion plays a significant role in addressing racial disparities in postpartum care (Englund, Daw, Backes Kozhimannil et al., 2016), and that state Medicaid coverage and expansion of postpartum contraception have positive effects on healthcare access and outcomes for postpartum women (Daley, Cohen et al., 2020).

## Access to Healthcare and Maternal Health Outcomes

A major factor contributing to the disparities in maternal health among Black women is the lack of access to health insurance (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics, 2018). Studies have shown that Medicaid expansion has a positive impact on access to care and health outcomes for postpartum women in the United States (Freedman, Cohen et al., 2019; Baum et al., 2019). Expanding Medicaid and extending postpartum coverage to at least one year can help address these disparities and improve maternal health outcomes for Black women (Daw, Backes Kozhimannil et al., 2016; Daw, Backes Kozhimannil et al., 2019).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, addressing structural racism and maternal health among Black women requires a multifaceted approach, including policy changes, education, and activism. Social workers play a crucial role in advocating for these changes and supporting vulnerable populations in accessing the necessary resources and care.
