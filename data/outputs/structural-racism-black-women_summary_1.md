### Paragraph 6

Addressing the disparities in maternal health care between Black and white women requires acknowledging and dismantling the structural racism that exists in the health care system. Taylor (2020) asserts that "the healthcare system must address the historical and structural barriers that hinder healthcare access for Black women and other women of color"[^4^]. This includes educating health care providers and staff on the history of racism in health care, as well as implementing policies and practices that promote equity and reduce bias[^35^]. One potential solution is to incorporate cultural competency training for health care providers, which can improve communication and understanding between providers and their patients[^36^]. Additionally, health care organizations can adopt policies that address implicit bias and support cultural competency in patient care[^37^].

### Paragraph 7

Another important aspect of addressing the disparities in maternal health care is advocating for policy changes that promote health equity. This includes supporting policies that expand access to quality health care services for Black women and other marginalized populations, such as the expansion of Medicaid and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act[^38^]. Furthermore, policy changes should address the social determinants of health, such as poverty and education, which disproportionately affect Black women and contribute to health disparities[^39^]. By addressing the root causes of these disparities, policy changes can help to bridge the gaps in maternal health care and improve the overall health of Black women.

### Paragraph 8

In conclusion, the legacy of racism and reproductive oppression has had a profound impact on the health and well-being of Black women in the United States. The disparities in maternal health care between Black and white women can be traced back to historical policies and practices that restricted Black women's access to quality health care and reproductive freedom. To address these disparities, it is essential to recognize and dismantle the structural racism that exists in the health care system and to advocate for policy changes that promote health equity for all women. By understanding the historical context of these disparities and implementing strategies to address them, health care providers and policymakers can work towards a more equitable and just health care system for all.
