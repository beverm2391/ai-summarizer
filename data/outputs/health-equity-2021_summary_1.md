# Health Equity Among Black Women in the United States: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Black women in the United States have experienced substantial improvements in health during the last century; however, health disparities persist. These disparities are largely due to the structural inequalities experienced by this population on a variety of social and economic measures, such as education, employment, and access to healthcare. The intersectionality of race and gender creates unique social and economic outcomes for Black women, which ultimately shape their health outcomes (Chinn, Martin, & Redmond, 2021). This essay aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of health equity among Black women in the United States, exploring the various factors that contribute to disparities in health outcomes and potential solutions to address these issues.

## Structural Inequalities and Health Outcomes for Black Women

Health outcomes do not occur independently of the social conditions in which they exist (Chinn et al., 2021). The social determinants of health (SDH) are the social and economic conditions that influence health outcomes and can be broadly categorized into four domains: structural factors, behavioral factors, biological and genetic factors, and environmental factors (Chinn et al., 2021). Structural inequality, the systematic disadvantaging of a group of people resulting from the unequal distribution of resources across society, is necessary to understand the health inequity experienced by Black women in the United States (Chinn et al., 2021).

Structural inequality influences health outcomes by limiting access to resources such as education, employment, and health care (Chinn et al., 2021). The higher burden of chronic conditions among Black women reflects the structural inequities within and outside the health system that they experience throughout the life course (Chinn et al., 2021). For instance, Black women experience higher rates of depression compared to White women, likely due to experiences of racism, discrimination, and microaggressions (Chinn et al., 2021).

## Health Disparities Among Black Women

Black women in the United States are disproportionately impacted by a number of health issues. These include hypertension, obesity, mental health issues, and maternal mortality and morbidity (Chinn et al., 2021). A key factor contributing to these disparities is the lack of access to quality health care, which is influenced by structural inequalities such as poverty, education, and employment opportunities.

Racism and discrimination also play a significant role in perpetuating health disparities among Black women. As Chinn et al. (2021) state, "racial discrimination is a toxic, uncontrollable or unpredictable stressor that is associated not only with poor physical health but also with psychological stress" (p. 214). This highlights the importance of addressing racism and discrimination within the healthcare system and society as a whole to promote health equity among Black women.

## Potential Solutions to Address Health Disparities

To address health disparities among Black women, it is essential to focus on addressing the underlying causes of these disparities, such as systemic racism, lack of access to healthcare, and lack of representation in medical research. Some potential solutions include:

1. **Addressing systemic racism:** Implementing policies and practices to dismantle systemic racism, both within and outside the healthcare system, can help reduce health disparities among Black women. This involves recognizing and addressing implicit biases among healthcare providers, promoting cultural competency in healthcare services, and advocating for policies that address social determinants of health.

2. **Increasing access to healthcare:** Ensuring that Black women have equal access to quality healthcare services is crucial in addressing health disparities. This involves advocating for policies that increase access to healthcare, such as expanding Medicaid, investing in community health centers, and addressing the shortage of healthcare providers in underserved communities.

3. **Increasing representation in medical research:** Black women are often underrepresented in biomedical research, which has implications for understanding the unique health needs of this population. Advocating for the inclusion of Black women in research studies and promoting diversity in medical research can help identify targeted interventions to address health disparities among Black women.

## Incorporating Health Equity into Social Work Practice

Social workers play a vital role in promoting health equity among Black women by understanding the unique needs of this population, providing culturally responsive and equitable care, and advocating for policies that address the underlying causes of health disparities. By being mindful of the intersectionality of race and gender when working with Black women, social workers can help create culturally sensitive and inclusive environments that promote health equity.

In field placement and future practice, social workers should strive to create a safe and affirming space for Black women, ensuring access to resources that address their social and economic needs. They should also advocate for policies that promote social and economic equity, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and inclusive environment for Black women in the United States.

## Conclusion

Health equity among Black women in the United States is a complex and multifaceted issue, influenced by a variety of factors, including systemic racism, lack of access to healthcare, and lack of representation in medical research. Addressing health disparities among Black women requires a comprehensive approach that targets the root causes of these disparities, such as policy changes and interventions that promote health equity. Social workers play a critical role in promoting health equity, advocating for policy changes, and providing culturally responsive care to Black women.
